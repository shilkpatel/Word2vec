I just spent some time playing with the beta version of urlLink Atmosphere Adobe's new 3D environment software and thought I'd give a couple of quick impressions I've always been interested in VR and spent quite a bit of time working in VRML but I think the inherant problem with VRML was that not enough attention had been given to community You could build all these really cool places but people couldn't interact in them You also couldn't easily move from one 3D environment to another without going back and forth between 2D web pages I was involved with a project that tried to solve some of these problems with VRML (anybody remember Terra Vista) but it didn't as far as we would have liked Atmosphere appears to have addressed these problems It's not the first product to do so but maybe Adobe has enough muscle for it to gain wide acceptance

New Mindjack today urlLink Twenty Twenty : Astronomical Vision by Chris McKinstry "Very early on a cold February morning in 1979 I looked with one of my highly astigmatic eyes through my first professional telescope at a setting Jupiter Even with my flawed vision the long white metal tube so finely manufactured it could have been a piece of sophisticated medical equipment let the cloud bands of our solar system’s largest planet and the bright points of a handful of its moons into my mind making me feel a shadow of the shock that Galileo must have felt when he saw the same sight before any of us "

urlLink Jim Lai reports on Digifest 2002 in the new issue of Mindjack 	 I didn't have much in the way of expectations going in to Digifest 2002; pretty pictures glitzy art/advertising pieces and possibly some cool tech I was pleasantly surprised by the breadth and depth of the presentations Wednesday night Hit the media session and got to see some graphics on a really big screen The theme of this international digital media festival was the "4-D challenge" to go beyond the third dimension I would deem this festival to be a success overall as by the end of the festival it would be apparent that there was much speculation on what constitutes this fourth dimension Now that I've spoiled the ending and gotten that out of the way on with the festival itself The original vision was for local (Toronto) participation but it quickly expanded in scope with the arrival of international submissions There was a soirée before the keynote where attendees could snack on catered food and mingle Quite a few people were there many of them either dressed hip or stylishly I almost felt that I was underdressed but I just put on my best casual face and it was all cool Business cards flowed like water

In the new Mindjack: a urlLink report on SXSW Interactive by Jon Lebkowksy with photos by urlLink Paul Bausch This year's South by Southwest Interactive conference was lean and mean - attended mainly by the core group of edgy 'net whackadistas the conference had an interesting vibe like "Wow glad the goddam dotcom splurge is over let's get back to what we were doin'…" And what we were doin' had real depth it was way more compelling than ecommerce or netpublishing the kinds of projects MBAs brought to the table when they started calling the Internet an 'industry' and creating the concept of the IPO casino

This week's Mindjack: urlLink Reading McLuhan by Melanie McBride If there's a message of the 'for dummies' age it's that nothing is beyond our grasp And our desire to believe this is reinforced by trends like usability which privilege economy over elucidation No one anticipated it all better than Marshall McLuhan who whittled big insights into sound bites in order to engage an audience beyond the lecture halls of the University of Toronto With the help of Tom Wolfe and others the scholarly McLuhan became a cool media prophet It was and still is a practical strategy in anti-intellectual times But in the process much of McLuhan's meaning has been reduced to a one-liner This has as much to do with the absence of commentary on McLuhan's literary philosophical and cultural influences as it does with the way his work is taught

urlLink Mindjack interviews Warren Ellis So why aren't you reading comics these days Really it doesn't seem to me that there are many comics being written for me I want something with a little more muscle and bite than standard-issue power fantasies whimsical romance the autobiographies of people who never do anything and things with elves The Western medium has cycles and it's currently in a creative downturn That doesn't mean there isn't excellent work being done That simply means there's not much of it And on a personal level little of it is talking to me Not many comics reflect the fact that I live in a multicultural society fitted with a global communications net nor do they reflect the fact that I don't own a pair of Superman underpants

Cory Doctorow urlLink reviews Smart Mobs in the new Mindjack: Smart Mobs are the Slashdot effect applied to the meatspace zeitgeist A squillion like-minded souls who don't know each other and will never meet pop out of the transmetropolitan brickface and break the white-noise balance of atomic viewpoints to speak with one voice roaring a righteous YES or an adamant NO without organizers without leaders without manifestoes or forethought Also this issue an in-depth look at urlLink the Internet Archive by Doug Roberts Tucked away in one of the seediest neighborhoods of San Francisco is a roomful of over two hundred computers with a terabyte of data stored on every three Stairs from the street lead up an intimidating hallway that opens into a room with 15-foot ceilings and just-this-side of hip ductwork in the ceiling To the right is a storage area with a single desk to the left are Baker's racks tightly packed with off-the-shelf HP desktop machines each turned on it's side to maximize the space Somewhere in all that ductwork a fan is squeaking painfully Walking into this echoey over-warm warehouse space it's easy to be underwhelmed until you realize what you are looking at: spinning away on these computers is nothing less than a copy of the Internet from 1996 until today
Mindjack is back after a short break The new issue has urlLink a report on the Supernova conference by Doug Roberts Supernova 2002 was an ambitious conference and Kevin Warbach the organizer along with pulvercom acknowledged that from the outset when he said that he had crammed a three day conference into two days The conference was touted as a glimpse into the decentralized future Decentralized systems as may be obvious are systems that have no single point of control - the Internet is a perfect example No one entity or agency controls it no single server provides the service and no single point of failure will bring down the system Warbach sees these types of systems as the fundamental issue in computing for the next decade By then end of day one however it became clear that the conference was going to be about one thing: blogging

Douglas Rushkoff meets Al Gore and is urlLink suitably impressed He was a much brighter open-minded and - if I might add - cosmic thinker than I gave him credit for before I felt like he was really one of "us" if you know what I mean: the kids in college who got those wild thoughts about how everything in the world and even beyond is connected somehow And evolving Only Gore found this organic view of reality reflected in the Constitution of the United States and sought to enable the extension of this Enlightenment thinking into practical reality

Mindjack contributor and game reviewer Justin Hall has written a great article on urlLink ethics in video game journalism for the Online Journalism Review The first print magazine covering video games Electronic Games was co-founded by Bill Kunkel in 1981 Kunkel describes those early days in a recent interview: “To an extent we were cheerleaders for the industry -- we loved these games we wanted to see more of them we wanted to keep writing about them” Not much has changed in the past 20 years Game publications and Web sites still mostly employ low-paid hobbyists who are easy targets of lavish marketing events that encourage inappropriate ties between game makers and game critics
This is incredible Scientists have discovered a "Colossal" squid in the Antartic much bigger than the previous biggest giant squid found And it's not even fully grown Deep sea exploration is nearly as fascinating to me as space exploration Just imagine that there's something like this that no one has ever seen alive It's interesting that the article notes the funding for the research is from the Discovery Channel While it's great there's some funding available just as with space exploration there should be much more
